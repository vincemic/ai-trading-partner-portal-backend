# GitHub Copilot Instructions for Trading Partner Portal

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL WORKFLOW REMINDER

**BEFORE ANY BUILD, TEST, OR DEPLOYMENT OPERATION:**

```
üõë STOP ‚Üí üßπ CLEAN ‚Üí üî® BUILD ‚Üí ‚úÖ TEST
```

1. **STOP**: All running VS Code tasks (API, watch, background processes)
2. **CLEAN**: Wait for complete process termination
3. **BUILD**: Use VS Code tasks to build solution
4. **TEST**: Run tests with clean environment

**This prevents 90% of development issues including:**

- File lock errors during builds
- Process conflicts during testing
- Port binding conflicts
- Inconsistent application state

## Development Environment Requirements

**ALWAYS use Visual Studio Code tasks for all development operations. Never use terminal commands directly.**

### Running Processes

**üö® CRITICAL: ALWAYS STOP RUNNING VS CODE TASKS BEFORE BUILDING OR TESTING üö®**

**MANDATORY PRE-BUILD CHECKLIST:**

1. **Check Terminal Panel**: Look for any running tasks (API, watch, background processes)
2. **Stop ALL running tasks**: Press `Ctrl+C` in EVERY terminal that shows running processes
3. **Wait for complete termination**: Ensure all processes have fully stopped (no more output)
4. **Verify no file locks**: No "TradingPartnerPortal.Api (process-id)" should appear in error messages
5. **Then proceed**: With build, test, or other operations

**Why this is critical:**

- Running API processes lock DLL files, causing build failures
- Integration tests can conflict with running API instances
- File locks prevent clean builds and deployments
- Multiple instances can cause port conflicts and unpredictable behavior

**Signs you forgot to stop processes:**

- Build errors: "Could not copy...dll...file is locked by: TradingPartnerPortal.Api"
- Port conflicts: "Address already in use" errors
- Test failures: Unexpected HTTP 500 errors
- VS Code hangs during build operations

When the user asks to:

- **Build the solution**: First stop any running API, then use Task ‚Üí "Build Solution"
- **Run tests**: First stop any running API, then use Task ‚Üí "Run Tests"
- **Start the API**: Use Task ‚Üí "Run Trading Partner Portal API"
- **Start API with HTTPS**: Use Task ‚Üí "Run Trading Partner Portal API (HTTPS)"
- **Watch tests**: Use Task ‚Üí "Watch Tests"
- **Validate API**: Use Task ‚Üí "Validate API Health" or "Full Validation Suite"

#### Process Check Workflow

1. **Before building/testing**: Check for running API processes
2. **If API is running**: Stop it using `Ctrl+C` in the terminal where it's running
3. **Wait for process to fully stop**: Ensure DLL files are unlocked
4. **Then proceed**: With build/test operations

### Stopping Processes

**STEP-BY-STEP: How to Stop Running VS Code Tasks**

1. **Check Terminal Panel**:

   - Press `Ctrl+`` (backtick) to open terminal panel
   - Look for tabs showing running processes:
     - "Run Trading Partner Portal API"
     - "Watch Tests"
     - "Build Solution"
     - Any other active tasks

2. **Stop Each Running Task**:

   - Click on the terminal tab showing the running process
   - Press `Ctrl+C` to send interrupt signal
   - Wait for the process to stop (look for command prompt to return)
   - Repeat for ALL running terminals

3. **Verify Complete Shutdown**:

   - All terminal tabs should show command prompts (not running processes)
   - No more continuous output or "Waiting for changes..." messages
   - Terminal titles should not show "(Running)" indicators

4. **Force Stop if Needed**:
   - If `Ctrl+C` doesn't work, close the entire terminal tab
   - Open new terminal: Terminal ‚Üí New Terminal
   - Use Task Manager to kill stubborn processes if necessary

**Alternative: Use Stop Background Tasks**

- Press `Ctrl+Shift+P`
- Run Task ‚Üí "Stop Background Tasks"
- This provides guidance but manual stopping is still required

When the user asks to stop running processes:

- **Background tasks**: Instruct to press `Ctrl+C` in the appropriate terminal panel
- **Never use terminal commands**: Refer to Task ‚Üí "Stop Background Tasks" for guidance

### Development Workflow

1. **Initial Setup**:

   - Task ‚Üí "Restore Packages"
   - Task ‚Üí "Build Solution"

2. **Development Loop**:

   - Make changes
   - Task ‚Üí "Build Solution" (check compilation)
   - Task ‚Üí "Run Tests" (verify functionality)
   - Task ‚Üí "Run Trading Partner Portal API" (test manually)

3. **Validation**:
   - Task ‚Üí "Full Validation Suite" (comprehensive check)
   - Task ‚Üí "Validate API Health" (quick health check)

### Debugging

- **Start debugging**: Press `F5` or use VS Code debug launch configurations
- **Launch configurations available**:
  - "Launch API (HTTP)"
  - "Launch API (HTTPS)"
  - "Attach to Process"

### Testing API Endpoints

- **Use REST client**: `.vscode/api-tests.http` file
- **Swagger UI**: Available at `http://localhost:5096/swagger` when API is running
- **Never use curl directly**: Always use the configured tools

### When to Use Each Task

| User Request         | Task to Use                            | Notes                     |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| "Build the project"  | Build Solution                         | Compiles and shows errors |
| "Run tests"          | Run Tests                              | One-time test execution   |
| "Start the API"      | Run Trading Partner Portal API         | HTTP only                 |
| "Start with HTTPS"   | Run Trading Partner Portal API (HTTPS) | HTTP + HTTPS              |
| "Watch for changes"  | Watch Tests                            | Continuous testing        |
| "Check if API works" | Validate API Health                    | Quick health check        |
| "Full validation"    | Full Validation Suite                  | Build + Test + Validate   |
| "Clean build"        | Clean Solution ‚Üí Build Solution        | Remove artifacts first    |

### Error Handling

- **Build errors**: Check Problems panel (`Ctrl+Shift+M`)
- **Test failures**: Check Terminal output from test task
- **API errors**: Check Terminal output from API task
- **Port conflicts**: Ensure ports 5096/7096 are available
- **File lock errors**: If you see "The process cannot access the file... because it is being used by another process", stop the running API first

#### Common File Lock Errors

If you encounter errors like:

```
error MSB3027: Could not copy "...TradingPartnerPortal.Application.dll"...
The file is locked by: "TradingPartnerPortal.Api (process-id)"
```

**Resolution steps**:

1. Find the terminal running the API (usually shows "Run Trading Partner Portal API")
2. Press `Ctrl+C` to stop the API process
3. Wait a few seconds for the process to fully terminate
4. Retry the build or test operation

### Best Practices

1. **Always check for running processes first**: Before build/test operations, ensure the API is not running
2. **Always build before testing**: Tasks have dependencies configured
3. **Use watch mode during development**: "Watch Tests" for continuous feedback
4. **Validate before committing**: "Full Validation Suite"
5. **Stop background tasks properly**: Use `Ctrl+C` in terminal panels
6. **Use REST client for API testing**: Avoid manual curl commands
